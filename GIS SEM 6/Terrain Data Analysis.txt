         Terrain Data Analysis       practical 4B

----------------------------------------------------------------
1)Layer  >  add Raster Layer  >  select "10n060e_20101117_gmted_mea300.tif" file from given folder

/* Enter 86.92,27.98 in the coordinate, scale 900000 and magnifier 100% bottom of QGIS (for himalaya region selection) */ 

2)crop the raster layer only for the region under study   
  > go to Raster  >  Extraction  >  clip raster by extent > [select input layer, extent, save file location]
  > press Run > (deselect the original layer and keep the clipped one)

3)Contour lines interval in raster  
  > go to Raster  >  Extraction  >  Contour (contour window will appear)
   > (select input layer, contour interval 100, attribute name ELEV, save location and file name)  >  press Run

4)right click on above created layer  >  properties  >  label the layer using ELEV field
								     >symbology select appropriate symbol

5)right click on above created layer  >  open attribute table  >  arrange table in descending order based on the value of "ELEV" column

/* To verify the above contour file using google map
	> make a copy of contour layer go to layer  >  save as 
	> select file format as "keyhole markup language", set file name, location and layer name
      > also set CRS to WGS 84 EPSG:4326
	> go to stored location on hard disk and open this kml file with google map  */ 

6) for hill shade surface analysis  > 
	/*   go to Plugin  >  install Georeferencer GADL   */ 

	> go to Raster  >  Analysis  >  Hill Shade  >  (select input raster layer, save file name and location for storing hill shade 										output )
	> press Run 

The output will display
